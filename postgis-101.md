PostGIS-101
===========

What is PostGIS?

---

PostGIS is a _spatial_ database.

---

Meaning,

---

it _stores_ spatial data

---

e.g.
* where are all the police stations?
* what is the temperature across the city?
* what are the boundaries of the police wards?
* where are all the ice cream parlors?

---

but also allows for the analysis of spatial data

---

e.g.
* What are the 2 closest ice cream shops to each police station?

---

Spatial on non-spatial data can be analysed at the same time

---

* What is the most cost effective ice cream shop given prices and driving distance relative to each police station?

---

And the analyses are _web scale_
